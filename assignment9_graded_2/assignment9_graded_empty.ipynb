There are empty cells (denoted as 'E'), pits ('P'), the evil Wumpus ('W') and a pot of gold ('G'). An agent ('A') has to find its way through the Wumpus world and ideally reach the gold.

The first two dimensions of the matrix is the position of the agent. The last dimension is the direction of the move (index 0 = north, index 1 = east, index 2 = south, index 3 = west).
